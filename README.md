# Natural Greedy Algorithm for Reduced Bases

Source code for the numerical experiments presented in the paper "The Natural Greedy Algorithm for reduced bases in Banach spaces".
The code is written and run in Octave but should be compatible with Matlab as well.

The preprint of the paper can be found at https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.06448
